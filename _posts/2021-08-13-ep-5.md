The show is back for season 2! We introduce our new host, Gina Andersen, and then talk about a [literature review research paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/learning-during-the-pandemic/learning-during-the-pandemic-review-of-international-research) out of the UK government on learning during the pandemic. In the interview segment, we talk to our guest, Naedyn Fanuga, from the [Mangrove Teens](https://instagram.com/mangrove_teens) team for the British Columbia International School of Bangkok, about the project, time management, and international outreach.
